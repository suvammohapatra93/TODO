### Project Overview - TODO
This project is a basic Todo App built using React. The application allows users to manage a list of tasks, providing functionality to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. It is designed to be a simple, yet functional demonstration of modern web development practices.
The app is developed using React for building the user interface, Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production, and Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and responsive design.
